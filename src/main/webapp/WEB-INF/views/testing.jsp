<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Testing
is the process of running a system with the intention of finding
errors. Testing enhances the integrity of a system by detecting
deviations in design and errors in the system. Testing aims at
detecting error-prone areas. This helps in the prevention of errors
in a system. Testing also adds value to the product by confirming to
the user requirements.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

main purpose of testing is to detect errors and error-prone areas in
a system. Testing must be thorough and well-planned. A partially
tested system is as bad as an untested system. And the price of an
untested and under-tested system is high.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

implementation is the final and important phase. It involves
user-training, system testing in order to ensure successful running
of the proposed system. The user tests the system and changes are
made according to their needs. The testing involves the testing of
the developed system using various kinds of data. While testing,
errors are noted and correctness is the mode. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

testing is a stage of implementation, which is aimed at ensuring that
the system works accurately and efficiently as per the user need,
before the live operation commences. As stated before, testing is
vital to the success of a system. System testing makes a logical
assumption that if all parts of the as system are correct, the goal
will be successfully achieved. A series of tests are performed before
the system is ready often the user acceptance test.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	testing focuses efforts on the smallest unit of software design.
	This is known as module testing. The modules are tested separately.
	The test is carried out during programming stage itself. In this
	step, each module is found to be working satisfactory as regards to
	the expected output from the module</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	can be lost across an interface. One module can have an adverse
	effect on another, sub functions, when combined, may not be linked
	in desired manner in major functions. Integration testing is a
	systematic approach for constructing the program structure, while at
	the same time conducting test to uncover errors associated within
	the interface. The objective is to take unit tested modules and
	builds program structure. All the modules are combined and tested as
	a whole.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	simple definition is that the validation succeeds when the software
